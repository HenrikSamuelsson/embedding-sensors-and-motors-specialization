# Sensor and Sensor Circuit Design: Quiz Week 1

## Example question 1

### ❓ Question

Which of the following is not a type of sensor in your smartphone?

⚪ Gyroscope  
⚪ Capacitive Touch Screen  
⚪ Pressure  
⚪ GPS  
⚪ Temperature  

### 📝 Solution

All listed items appear in some form in smartphones:

  - **Gyroscope:** Detects rotation/motion.
  - **Capacitive Touch Screen:** Detects user input — technically a type of sensor.
  - **GPS:** Receives satellite signals to determine location — not a sensor in the traditional sense (i.e., not measuring a physical property of the phone’s environment).
  - **Temperature:** Used internally for CPU and battery monitoring — not for ambient sensing.
  - **Pressure (Barometer):** Present in some smartphones, but not universal.

The quiz most likely expects **Pressure** as the answer, since it’s less commonly included.

### 🎯 Answer

**Pressure** (as expected by quiz makers, though interpretation may vary)
