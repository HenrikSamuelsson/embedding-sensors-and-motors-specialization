# 🎓 Course 1 Introduction — Embedding Sensors and Actuators

## 🧠 Who This Course Is For

- No one is expected to be an expert on sensors and actuators — this course builds your expertise from the ground up.
- If you're already an expert, you might be wasting your time here (humor intended!).

## 📚 What You'll Learn in Course 1

### 🔥 Focus Area: Temperature Sensors  
- Described as the "granddaddy" of all sensors.
- Historical roots: goes back to the 18th century (Fahrenheit and Celsius).
- You'll gain hands-on experience with:
  - Thermocouples
  - RTDs (Resistance Temperature Detectors)
  - Thermistors

### 🧰 Development Kit
- You’ll get started with both **hardware and software**.
- Labs will cover:
  - Wiring sensors into a circuit
  - Schematic diagrams
  - Working with amplifiers
  - Interfacing sensors with your kit

### ↻ Other Topics Covered
- **Rotary sensors** with lab work
- **Amplifiers**:
  - Circuit diagrams
  - Grade equation derivations
  - Noise and filtering issues
  - How to read and interpret **spec sheets**

📌 *Reminder:* Every sensor circuit requires an amplifier — there's no such thing as a sensor without one.
