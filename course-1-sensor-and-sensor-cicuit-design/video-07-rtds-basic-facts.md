# 🌡️ Video 7 – RTDs: Basic Facts

## 📘 Overview

This video introduces **RTDs (Resistance Temperature Detectors)**, covering their construction, accuracy, temperature range, industry standards, tolerances, and common applications.

## 🧪 What Is an RTD?

- **RTD** = Resistance Temperature Detector
- Measures temperature based on the **change in resistance** of a metal with temperature.
- Originally made from **platinum wire coils** wrapped around ceramic or glass.
- Modern RTDs use **thin-film platinum layers** deposited on a **ceramic substrate**.
- Resistance value is controlled by the **length and pattern** of the platinum trace.

## 🔢 Key Characteristics

- **Typical Range**: –200 °C to +800 °C
- **Standard**: IEC 60751 (also known as DIN)
  - Specifies **100 Ω at 0 °C**
  - Temperature coefficient: **0.00385 Ω/Ω/°C** between 0–100 °C

### 📏 Tolerances

- **Class A**:
  - Tolerance: **±0.06 Ω at 0 °C**
- **Class B**:
  - Tolerance: **±0.12 Ω at 0 °C**

These tolerances are defined by equations depending on temperature, but you can roughly think of **Class A as twice as accurate** as Class B.

## 📉 Linear vs Nonlinear Response

- RTDs have a **very linear response**, though not perfectly so.
- Compared to other sensors:
  - **NTC thermistor**: nonlinear with steep slope
  - **PTC thermistor**: nonlinear with positive curve
  - **RTD**: nearly a straight line with positive slope
- **Calibration** is required for high-precision applications.

---

## 🏭 Applications

- **High-accuracy** temperature measurement where stability is crucial
- Ideal for **inaccessible environments**, e.g. aerospace (e.g. space shuttle)
- Widely used in:
  - **Pharmaceuticals** (repeatability and reliability)
  - **Gas/air stream** measurements (requires exposed RTD for faster response)
  - **Hot wire anemometers** (operate RTD in reverse)

## 🧰 Commercial RTD Form Factors

- **Surface-mount** chip (e.g. 0603 RTD from Vishay)
- **Surface probes** that bolt to metal surfaces
- **Threaded stainless steel probes** (e.g. for tanks and furnaces)
- **Sanitary probes** used in pharmaceutical industry:
  - Designed to meet **Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)** standards
  - Often appear explosion-proof

## ✅ Recap

- RTDs are stable, accurate, and repeatable temperature sensors.
- Work over wide temperature ranges with nearly linear behavior.
- Available in many commercial form factors.
