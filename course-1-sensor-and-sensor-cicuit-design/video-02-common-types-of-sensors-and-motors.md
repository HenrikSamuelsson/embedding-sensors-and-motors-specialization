## ‚öôÔ∏è Actuator Types

### 1. **Hydraulic Actuators**
- Use compressed oil.
- Found in construction equipment (e.g., lifts, cranes).
- **Slow response** due to oil compression and high gear ratios.

### 2. **Pneumatic Actuators**
- Use compressed air.
- Faster response than hydraulics.
- Common in production assembly.
- **Drawbacks**: Noisy and prone to leaks.

### 3. **Electrical Motors**
- Convert electrical energy into **rotary motion**.
- Will be used extensively in this course.

#### Types of Electrical Motors:

- **Stepper Motors**
  - Multiple coils in phases.
  - Sequentially energized for precise step-by-step rotation.

- **Brushed DC Motors**
  - Coils generate a magnetic field on a rotating armature.
  - Brushes reverse current each half-cycle to maintain rotation.
  - **Cons**: Brushes wear out and need replacement.

- **Brushless DC Motors**
  - Use permanent magnets and a fixed armature.
  - Rotation achieved by electronic phase switching.
  - **Advantage**: No brushes, so less maintenance.

### 4. **Mechanical Actuators**
- Gears, belts, and lead screws.
- Used to **increase torque** or convert rotary to linear motion.
