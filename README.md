# Embedding Sensors and Motors Specialization

Notes and projects from the *Embedding Sensors and Motors Specialization* offered by the University of Colorado Boulder on Coursera.

## Courses

This specialization consists of four courses covering the design of sensors and motors, 
and methods to integrate them into embedded systems. Hands-on projects are included, 
involving building systems with sensors and motors, along with software algorithms 
needed to configure and operate them. The hardware and firmware solutions will include 
handling of real-time data and processing.

We will measure and record metrology data using oscilloscope traces and apply methodologies 
to amplify, filter, and optimize signals.

The four courses are:  
  - Sensors and Sensor Circuit Design (25 h)  
  - Motors and Motor Control Circuits (36 h)  
  - Pressure, Force, Motion, and Humidity Sensors (23 h)  
  - Sensor Manufacturing and Process Control (55 h)
