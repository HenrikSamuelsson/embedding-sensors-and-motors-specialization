# Embedding Sensors and Motors Specialization

Notes and projects from the *Embedding Sensors and Motors Specialization* offered by the University of Colorado Boulder on Coursera.

## Courses

There are four courses in this specialization that will cover design of sensors and motors, and methods to integrate them into embedded systems. Hand on projectes are included building systems with sensors and motors, including software with algorithms needed to configure and run sensors and motors. The hardware and firmware solutions will include handlig of real-time data an processing. We will meausre and record metorlogy data with oscilloscope traces and use metholodgies to amplify, filter, and optimize the signals.

The four courses are 
  - Sensors and Sensor Circuit Design (25 h)
  - Motors and Motor Contro Circuits (36 h)
  - Pressure, Force, Motion, and Humidity Sensors (23 h)
  - Sensor Manufacturing and Process Control (55 h)
